# diabetes-risk-global-health-analysis
Data analysis project exploring diabetes risk predictions and global health indicators using Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau

## suggested portfolio structure
1. introduction
2. data source and context of the files
3. data preperation and cleaning
4. exploratory analaysis of predicted diabetes dataset (file 1)
5. exploratory anlysis of the global health datset (file 2)
6. linking the two datasets
7. visualisations and key findings
8. limitations and future work
9. reflection of skills what you have learned

### explaining each step
1. explain why i should care about this topic and how it is affected by global health, get them to understand what my project is trying to uncover?
2. describe each dataset, its origin and key variables
3. how did you check quality, remove issues and prepare the data
4. describe the relationships and any patterns i saw in the predicted data set
5. summarise the global patterns in the health/economic data that are relevant for diabetes
6. explain what type of files/datasets these are and what that means for the portfolio, then mention what connections can be made
7. show the description with images or try to upload the work
8. limitations to the study, dataset, connections missing due to...
9. short reflection that makes it feel like a portfolio, not just a report
