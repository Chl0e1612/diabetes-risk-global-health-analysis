## step 1: clean in excel
- rename columns (diagnosed diabetes to predicted probability and id to person id)
- remove duplicates
- checked for missing values
- ensure probabilities are numeric as certain ones were text
- add risk categories using code= =IF(B2<0.33,"Low Risk",IF(B2<0.66,"Medium Risk","High Risk"))

## step 2: analsyse in python
- load cleaned CSV
- check distribution
- plot histogram of probabilities
- calculate % high risk
- save plots into image folder and ppt

## step 3: power BI
creat visuals such as:
- 

## step 4: Tableau
create story pages and visualisation:
- probability distribution
- risk segmentation
- comparison with global dataset (dashboards)
