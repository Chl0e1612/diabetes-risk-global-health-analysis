Dataset 1= Predicted diabetes
Dataset 2= global health

Best variables from dataset to link to diabetes:
1. metabolic/ cardiovascular conditions
-% Death Cardiovascular
-Air Pollution Death Rate – Ischaemic Heart Disease
-Air Pollution Death Rate – Stroke
-Chronic Respiratory Disease Mortality (weaker link but still lifestyle-related)

Why it’s useful:
Diabetes patients have 2–4× higher risk of heart disease → strong link for dashboard insights.

2. Nutrition and diet composition:
-Diet Composition Sugar
-Diet Calories Carbohydrates
-Diet Calories Fat
-Diet Composition Oils and Fats
-Fruit Consumption categories
-Cereal consumption categories

Why it’s useful:
Sugar, high-carb diets, and fats strongly influence type 2 diabetes risk.

3. Economic indicators:
-GDP per Capita
-GNI per Capita
-Government Expenditure on Health
-Income per Capita

Why it’s useful:
Higher-income countries often have higher obesity & diabetes rates due to lifestyle + nutrition patterns.

4. Demographics:
- % population aged 65+
- % population aged 70-74, 75-79, 80+
- %population aged 15-64

why its useful:
you can compare age distribution from your diabetes dataset (file 1) with global aging population trends

5. Mortality indicators
- infant mortality rate
- neonatal mortality
- maternal mortality ratio
- death rate total
showing country development levels
